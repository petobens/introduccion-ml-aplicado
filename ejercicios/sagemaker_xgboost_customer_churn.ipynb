This notebook describes using machine learning (ML) for the automated identification of unhappy customers, also known as customer churn prediction. ML models rarely give perfect predictions though, so this notebook is also about how to incorporate the relative costs of prediction mistakes when determining the financial outcome of using ML.\n",

And if my provider knows that I’m thinking of leaving, it can offer timely incentives–I can always use a phone upgrade or perhaps have a new feature activated–and I might just stick around. Incentives are often much more cost effective than losing and reacquiring a customer.\n",

    "Mobile operators have historical records on which customers ultimately ended up churning and which continued using the service. We can use this historical information to construct an ML model of one mobile operator’s churn using a process called training. After training the model, we can pass the profile information of an arbitrary customer (the same profile information that we used to train the model) to the model, and have the model predict whether this customer is going to churn. Of course, we expect the model to make mistakes–after all, predicting the future is tricky business! But I’ll also show how to deal with prediction errors.\n",

    "Of the 48 churners, we've correctly predicted 39 of them (true positives). And, we incorrectly predicted 4 customers would churn who then ended up not doing so (false positives).  There are also 9 customers who ended up churning, that we predicted would not (false negatives).\n",

    "An important point here is that because of the `np.round()` function above we are using a simple threshold (or cutoff) of 0.5.  Our predictions from `xgboost` come out as continuous values between 0 and 1 and we force them into the binary classes that we began with.  However, because a customer that churns is expected to cost the company more than proactively trying to retain a customer who we think might churn, we should consider adjusting this cutoff.  That will almost certainly increase the number of false positives, but it can also be expected to increase the number of true positives and reduce the number of false negatives.\n",
